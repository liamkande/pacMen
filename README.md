# PacMen

PacMen is a fun and interactive game where players can add and control multiple pacmen on their screen. The game features a user-friendly interface with two buttons - Add PacMan and Start Game. When the Add PacMan button is clicked, a new pac-man character will appear at a random position on the screen. Clicking the Start Game button will set the pacmen in motion, moving at a random velocity across the screen. Pacmen are programmed to change direction and stay within the frame of the web page when they hit the edge of the screen.
